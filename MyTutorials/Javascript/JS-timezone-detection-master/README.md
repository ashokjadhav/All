JS-timezone-detection
=====================

Automatically detect your userâ€™s time zone using JavaScript

**Demo**

Read a post on my blog about [how it works](http://www.onlineaspect.com/2007/06/08/auto-detect-a-time-zone-with-javascript/).

**Update**

Jon Nylander has taken my original code and written [a more robust solution](https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect). I encourage you to check out his version and use it instead.
